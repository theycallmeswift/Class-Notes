# Multiply Two N-Digit Numbers

   X = 2^(n/2) * Xl + Xr
   Y = 2^(n/2) * Yl + Yr

Ex. `n = 8, 11010111`

    Xl = 1101
    Xr = 0111

    11010111 = 2^4 * 1101 + 0111
             = 16 * 13 + 7

`X * Y = 2^n(Xl)(Yl) + 2^(n/2) * [Xl * Yr + Yl * Xr] + Xr * Yr`

We can compute this with only 3 multiplications:

    A = Xl * Yl
    B = Xr * Yr
    C = (Xl + Xr)(Yl + Yr)

    X*Y = 2^(n/2) * A + 2^(n/2) * (C - A - B) + B

This comes down to: `F(n) = 3*F(n/2) + O(n)`

What is the order of this? Use the master theorm!

      log_b(a) > d
    = log_2(3) > 1

    F(n) = n^log_2(3)

# Finding the Median

Input: An array (A) of N numbers
Output: The median value of A

## Selection

 - Selection(A, k) = k-th smallest element of A
 - Median(A) = Selection(A, Ceiling(N / 2))

## Algorithm (randomized)

 1. Select a random element v from A
 2. Classify all elements of A into 3 groups:
    - smaller than v (Al)
    - equal to v (Av)
    - larger than v (Ar)
 3. Recurse on the group that contains the element

```
                 | selection(Al, k)           if k <= Al
Selection(A.k) = | v                          if Al < k < Al + Av
                 | selection(Ar, k - Al - Av) if k > Al + Ak
```

### Correctness

Al contains the first |Al| smallest elements

Av contains the next |Av| smallest elements

Ar contains the final |Ar| smallest elements

if {k | Al} then selection is in Al

if {k | Al + 1 -> Al + Av} then selection is in Av

if {k | Al + Av + 1 -> Ar} then selection is in Ar


*Formula always holds, even if the parts aren't sorted.*

### Running Time Analysis

If the pivot falls between the 25th and 75th percentile (which happens 50% of
the time), then both Al and Ar are less than or equal to 3/4 * n.

    k = # of rounds to reduce n to 3n/4
           E[k] = 2
    E[k * O(n)] = E[k] * E[O(n)]
                = 2 * O(n)
                = O(n)

Recurrence: `T(n) = T(3n/4) + O(n)`
