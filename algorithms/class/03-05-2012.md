## DFS Algorithm

     DFS(G):
      for all v in V where discovered(v) == false
        clock = 0
      for all v in V where discovered(v) == false
        explore(G, v)

    Explore(G, v)
      discovered(v) = true
      clock++
      for each (v,u) in E
        if (v,u) is not yet discovered explore(u)
        clock++
        post[v] = clock

## Proof of post 2l start

### Claim:

For a path of length l, the node with post(v) = 2l is always the starting node

### Proof:

When we explore the starting node, we discover all node the haven't been
discovered before. When we hit the starting node, we are destined to find all
the unexplored nodes.
