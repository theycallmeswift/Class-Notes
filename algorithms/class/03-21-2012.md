# Review

__DAG__ - Directed, asyclical graph.  These are good because they can all be
topologically sorted.

How do we convert a directed graph from an undirected graph?

Easy! We replace all the edges with an edge pointing in each direction.  This
results in the connected components in the undirected graph.

# Breadth First Search

__Distance__ - The length of the shortest path between two nodes.  The length
of the path is the # of edges in the path.

    Distance(A, A) = 0
    Distance(A, B) = Infinity (When no path exists)

We can sort a graph by layers of distance from the root node.

         7 <----- 6
         ^        ^
         |        |
    ---> 3 -> 4   |
    |    ^    ^   |
    |    |    |   |
    1 -> 2 ---|-->5

Results in:

    layer   0 1 2 3
            S 3 7 6
              2 4
                5

In layer i I only get the nodes that are Distance = i from those nodes

## Algorithm:

    BFS = (G, s) ->
      for vertex in G.vertexes
        distance(vertex) = Infinity
      distance(s) = 0

      Queue.enqueue(s)

      while Queue.length > 0
        for edge in Queue.dequeue()
          if distance(edge.vertex) == Infinity
            distance(edge.vertex) = distance(edge.vertex) + 1
