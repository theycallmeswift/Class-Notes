# Minimum Weight Spanning Trees

Find the minimum spanning tree with the cheapest cost (in terms of weight).

__Lemma__: If you have a connected graph and there is a cycle, then you can remove
an edge from the cycle such that the remaining graph is still connected.


__Spanning Tree__: A sub tree of a graph G that reaches all the nodes in G.

__Lema__: All spanning trees have N - 1 edges
