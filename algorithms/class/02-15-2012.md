# Matricies

## Multiplication

    | a(1,1) ...   ...   |   | b(1,1) ...   ...   |   | c(1,1) ...   ...   | 
    |  ...   ...   ...   | x |  ...   ...   ...   | = |  ...   ...   ...   | 
    |  ...   ...  a(i,j) |   |  ...   ...  b(i,j) |   |  ...   ...  c(i,j) | 

    c(i,j) = SUM[1..k] of a(i,k) * b(k, j)

## Complexity

The number of arithmatic opperations. For matrix multiplication the complexity
is O(n^3).

## Special Matricies

Identity Matrix:

    | 1  1  1  1 |   | 1  1  1  1 |   | 4 0 0 0 |
    | 1 -1  1 -1 | x | 1 -1  1 -1 | = | 0 4 0 0 |
    | 1  1 -1 -1 |   | 1  1 -1 -1 |   | 0 0 4 0 |
    | 1 -1 -1  1 |   | 1 -1 -1  1 |   | 0 0 0 4 |

    | 1 0 0 0 |
    | 0 1 0 0 | x 4 = 4 * I
    | 0 0 1 0 |
    | 0 0 0 1 |

Martixies within Matrrixies:

    A = | 1  1 |
        | 1 -1 |

    A^2 = | 1  1 | * | 1  1 | = | 2 0 |
          | 1 -1 |   | 1 -1 |   | 0 2 |

    | A  A | * | A  A | = | 2A^2  0   |
    | A -A |   | A -A |   |  0   2A^2 |

      | 4 0 0 0 |
    = | 0 4 0 0 |
      | 0 0 4 0 |
      | 0 0 0 4 |

In general:

    | A1 A2 | x | B1 B2 | = | (A1B1 + A2B3) (A1B2 + A2B4) |
    | A3 A4 |   | B3 B4 |   | (A3B1 + A4B3) (A3B2 + A4B4) |

## Divide and conquor:

This gives us a divide and conquor algorithm for multiplying matricies:

    F(n) = 8F(n/2) + O(n^2)

By the master theorm, we can compute this is O(n^3)

    log_b(a) >=< d
    log_2(8) > 2

    O(n^log_2(8)) = O(n^3)

If we could do this in 7 opperations, it would give us an advantage though
(Strausan).

    log_2(7) < log_2(8)

## Hadamard Matricies

Hadamard matricies are recursive matricies that are the inverses of
themselves. Programmers like them because if you select a column at random, it
is a sequence of trues and falses (heads and tails).

    H0 = | 1 |

    H1 = | H0  H0 | = | 1  1 |
         | H0 -H0 |   | 1 -1 |

    H2 = | H1  H1 |  H3 = | H2  H2 |
         | H1 -H1 |       | H2 -H2 |

    ....


### How big is Hi^2?

    Hi^2 = 2^i * I_2i

### Proof by Induction:

Base case:

    H0 = | 1 | = 2^0 * | 1 | = | 1 |

Inductive case:

    | Hi  Hi | x | Hi  Hi | = | 2*Hi^2   0    |
    | Hi -Hi |   | Hi -Hi |   |   0    2*Hi^2 |

    2*Hi^2 = 2 * 2^(i-1) * I by the inductional hypothesis

    = 2^i * | I 0 |
            | 0 I |

## Matrix Vector Multiplication

    | a(1,1) ...   ...   |   | b1 |   | c1 |
    |  ...   ...   ...   | x | .. | = | .. |
    |  ...   ...  a(i,j) |   | bj |   | cj |

    ci = SUM[1..K] of a(i,k) * bk

### What is the complexity?

Theta(N^2) (in terms of mathmatical ops)

__Reminder__ - Theta means both upper and lower bound are N^2

We can't do any better than that because the original matrix is N by N, so
we're dealing with at least N^2 + N opperations anyways...

HOWEVER, there are special matricies that we CAN improve on our N^2
complexity.  For example the Idenity matrix * vector b.

    I * b = b

For the Hadamard matricies we can also do better than N^2.

    | H(i-1)  H(i-1) | * | bl | = | H(i-1)*bl + H(i-1)*br |
    | H(i-1) -H(i-1) |   | br |   | H(i-1)*bl - H(i-1)*br |

    = | H(i-1) * (bl + br) |
      | H(i-1) * (bl - br) |

Which is about `O(n)` opperations!

Running Time:  `F(n) = 2 * F(n/2) + O(n)`

    log_2(2) >=< 1
    1 = 1

    O(n * log(n)) (which is better than O(n^2))


## Fast Fourier Transform

Special matrix `w^n = 1` is the sequence `n = 2^k`

           | w^0 w^0 ... w^0   |
    M(w) = | w^0 w^1 ... w^n-1 |
           | ... ... ... ...   |
           | ... ... ... w^ij  |

           | b1 |
    M(w) * | .. |
           | bj |


Example:

    | 1 2 | x | 1 | = |  5 |
    | 3 4 |   | 2 |   | 11 |

    | 2 1 | x | 2 | = |  5 |
    | 4 3 |   | 1 |   | 11 |

How can we make this recursive?

        2j'            2j' + 1
    | 0 2 4 ... n-2 : 1 3 5 ... n-1 |
    | ... ... ...   : ... ... ...   |
    |    w^(2ij')   :   w^(2ij'+i)  |

    0 <= j' <= n/2 - 1
    0 <= i' <= n/2 - 1

    |  w^2i'j' | w^2i'j' + i |
    | w^2i'j'  |             |

    M_n(w) = | M_(n/2)(w^2) |
             | M_(n/2)(w^2) |
