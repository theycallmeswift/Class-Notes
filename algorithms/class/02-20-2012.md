# Complex Numbers

Consider mod 3 arithmetic where there are 2 operations plus (+) and times
(x).

  F3 = {0,1,-1}

     1 + 1 = -1  (mod 3)
     0^2 = 0     (mod 3)
     1^2 = 1     (mod 3)
    -1^2 = 1     (mod 3)

`x^2 = -1` cannot be solved, so introduce a new element `j` such that `j^2 = -1`

We ought to be able to add and multiple with `j` just like any other number in
mod 3.

    (1 - j)^2 = 1 + j^2 - j - j
              = 1 + j^2 + j
              = j

The resulting set of elements is:

    0,   j,  1 + j,  -1 + j,
    1,  -j,  1 - j,  -1 - j,
   -1

We can add and multiple any of these 9 numbers and always remain within the
original 9 as our result.

    (-1 - j) + (-1 - j) = 1 + j

F9 arises from F3 by adjoining the root of `X^2 + 1 = 0`

## Multiplying complex numbers

    (3i + 2)(10i + 5) = -30 + 10 + 15i + 20i
                      = -20 + 35i

In general: `(a + bi)(c + di) = ac - bd + (bc + ad)i`

Every complex number except 0 has an inverse.

    1 / (a+bi) = ?
    (a + bi) * x = 1
    (a + bi)(a - bi) = a^2 - (bi)^2
                     = a^2 + b^2

     X = a / (a^2 + b^2) - bi / (a^2 + b^2)

## Multiplying Complex Numbers on the Unit Circle

By adding i to the reals, we can solve all polynomial equations.

    x^n = 1

See: http://www.suitcaseofdreams.net/Roots_complex.htm

What are the roots?

    w0 = 1
    w1 = cos(2π/5) + i * sin(2π/5)
    w2 = cos(2 * 2π/5) + i * sin(2 * 2π/5)
    w3 = cos(3 * 2π/5) + i * sin(3 * 2π/5)
    w4 = cos(4 * 2π/5) + i * sin(4 * 2π/5)

When we multiply these roots, they form a mod 5 arithmatic with addition

    w0 * w0 = w0
    w2 * w3 = w0 (since 2 + 3 = 5 mod 5 = 0)
    w1 * w2 = w3 (since 1 + 2 = 3 mod 5 = 3)

In general:

      (cos(A) + i*sin(A))(cos(B) + i * sin(B))
    = cos(a) * cos(B) - sin(A) * sin(B) + cos(A+B) + i * sin(A+B)

    | 1  1  1  1  1 |   |  3 |   |     |
    | 1 w1 w2 w3 w4 |   |  2 |   |     |
    | 1 w2 w4 w1 w3 | x | -1 | = | ... |
    | 1 w3 w1 w4 w2 |   |  2 |   |     |
    | 1 w4 w3 w2 w1 |   | 10 |   |     |

    | 1  1  1  1 |
    | 1  i -1 -i |
    | 1 -1  1 -1 |
    | 1 -i -1  i |
