# Topological Sort

__Input__: Directed graph `G`

__Output__: Ordering of the nodes such that each edge points forwards

Example:

        -> 2 -
      /    ^   \
    1      |     -> 4
      \    |   /
        -> 3 -

    Sorted: 1, 3, 2, 4

## Magic Algorithm

 1. Run DFG on G keeping track of pre and post numbers
 2. Sort the nodes in decreasing post order

## What if G has a cycle?

There is no topological sort if there is a cycle in the graph.  But how can we
detect cycles?

__Definition__: G has a cycle iff there is an edge that links to an ancestor
in the tree (AKA a back edge).

## Proof

__ Case__: The graph has no cycles

__Claim__: For every edge (x,y) of G, post(x) > post(y)

__Case 1__: (x,y) is a tree edge - The post # only increments when all
subtrees have been explored and since y is a subtree of x, post(x) must be
greater than post(y)

__Case 2__: (x,y) is a forward edge - For the same reason as case 1, except y
is a subtree of x with only one node

__Case 3__: (x,y) is a cross edge - You have to process y completely before
you process x, so you could never know that it was a cross edge until you had
completely explored all of y.

__Case 4__: (x,y) is a back edge - Not possible, since there would be no
topological sort so therefore we can ignore it.

# Strongly Connected Components

Strongly connected components of a graph cannot have cycles because then by
definition the two components would be strongly connected.

## Algorithm

    Strong Components(G):
      components[]

      Run DFS on reverse(G)
      Relabel nodes of reverse(G) in decreasing post order
      Run DFG on the relabeled G

      Every time we need to jumpstart the DFS, push the tree onto components

__Claim__: If we run DFS on reverse(G), then the node with the largest post
number will fall into the "last" strong component (AKA the sync node).
