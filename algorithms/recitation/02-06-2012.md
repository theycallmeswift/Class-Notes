## Homework Problems

What is the last digit of 17^17^17?

```
  17^1 mod 10 = 7
  17^2 mod 10 = 9
  17^3 mod 10 = 3
  17^4 mod 10 = 1
  17^5 mod 10 = 7
  ... Repeats Cyclically ...
```

```
   17^17 mod 10
 = 17^(4k+1) mod 10
 = (17^4)^k * 17 mod 10
 = 1^k * 17 mod 10
 = 7
```

## Finding the GCD of two polynomials

To find the GCD, factorize into the prime factors (a set of polynomials with
less degress multiplied by eachother).

### General tips

a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)
a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)
a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)

Ex. Factor (xy)^6 - 64
  = ((xy)^3 + 8)((xy)^3 - 8)
  = ((xy)^3 + 2^3)((xy)^3 - 2^3)

### Finding GCD of polynomials

Ex. GCD(x^2 + 7x + 6, x^2 - 5x + 6)

x^2 + 7x + 6 = (x+6)(x+1)
x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x-6)(x+1)

GCD(x^2 + 7x + 6, x^2 - 5x + 6) = (x + 1)

## RSA

[ Alice ] -> [ Bob ]

1. Bob picks two very large prime numbers p and q.
2. N = p * q
3. Bob picks e which is a small relatively prime # to (p-1)(q-1)
4. Bob computes d which is the multiplicative inverse of e mod (p-1)(q-1)
5. Bob publishes the pair (N, e) and keeps d secret

Alice encrypts message M by mapping C = M to M^2 mod N
Bob decryps the message (M = C^d mod N)

Proof: (M^e)^d mod N = M
e,d -> multiplicative inverse of mod (p-1)(q-1)
ed = k(p-1)(q-1) + 1
M^(ed) = M * (M^(p-1))^(k*(q-1)) mod p
M^(ed) = M * 1^(k*(q-1)) mod p
M^(ed) = M mod p = M

### NP-complete

Given a solution, you can verify that it is correct in polynomial time.
In order to find a solution, it requires exponential tme.

Ex. Traveling Salesman Problem.

### P class Problems

Solution can be found in polynomial times.
P = NP is the idea that all NP problems can be reduced into P class problems.

## Fermats Little Theorm

S = {1,2,...,p-1} (mod p)
(a mod p) * S = {a mod p * 1, a mod p * 2, ..., a mod p * (p-1)}

(p - 1)! = a^(p-1) * (p - 1)! mod p
a^(p-1) = 1 (mod p)
