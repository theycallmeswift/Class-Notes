# Quiz review

Question: Write a function that solves `ax + by = 1` (Bezout's Identity)

## In O(n^2) time

    for x = 0 to infinity
      for y = 0 to infinity
         return [x, y] if a*x + b*y == 1

## In O(n) time

    for x = 0 to infinity
      return [x,y] if y == (1 - a*x) / b

# Hashing

Maps a key to a hash value.  If the number of possibilities is small enough
(letters A - Z), we could use the binary representation of the value as the
hashing function.  Another simple hash function would be `mod`.

## Perfect Hashing

Maps each valid input to a unique hash value.  When all the slots are used,
this is referred to as "Minimum" perfect hashing

## Other Hashing Function

 - Division Method: `k mod m`
 - Multiplication Method: `h(k) = floor(m((kA) mod 1))`
 - Universal Hashing:
    - Select a hashing function at random from a family of functions
    - If the chain is too long, pick another function and reconstruct

## Universal Hashing

A probability distribution H over hash functions from U to {1,..,M} is
iniversal if for all x !== y in U, we have:

    P[ h(x) == h(y) ] < 1/M

# Divide & Conquer

## Strategy

  1. Break problem into subproblems
  2. Recursivly solve subproblems
  3. Combine the solutions

Ex: Merge Sort

## Recurence Functions

    T(n) = a * T(n/b) + D(n) + C(n)

    D = division complexity
    C = combination complexity
    b = # of subproblems at each step
    a = branching factory

## Master Theorm

The master theorm is the "cookbook" for solving recurrences of the form:

    T(n) = a * T(n/b) + O(n^d), a >= 1, b >1, d >= 0

           | O(n^d)          if d > log_b(a)
    T(n) = | O(n^d * log(n)) if d = log_b(a)
           | O(n^(log_b(a))) if d < log_b(a)

### Examples:

1. T(n) = 9 * T(n/3) + n

    = log_b(a)
    = log_3(9)
    = 2

    2 > 1 --> Option 3

    O(n^2) is the upper bound


2. T(n) = T(2n/3) + 1

    = log_b(a)
    = log_(2/3)(1)
    = 0

    d = 0
    0 == 0, option 2

    O(n^0 * log(n)) = O(log(n))

3. T(n) = 3 * T(n/4) + n * log(n)

    = log_b(a)
    = log_4(3)
    = 0.793

    O(n^(0.793)) < O(n * log(n))

    O(n * log(n))

4. T(n) = T(n/2) + 2^n

    F(n) = 2^n
    n^log_b(a) = n^log_2(1) = n^0 = 1

    n^log_b(a) = O(F(n))

5. T(n) = 3 * T(n/3) = sqrt(n)

    F(n) = n^(1/2)
    n^log_b(a) = n^log_3(3) = n

    F(n) = n^(1/2) = O(n)

## Quicksort

Fast and efficient method for in place sorting.

    Quicksort(A, p, r)
      if p < r
        q = partition(A, p, r)
        Quicksort(A, p, q-1)
        Quciksort(A, q+1, r)

Best Case:  O(n*log(n))
Worst Case: O(n^2)

### Worst Case

Occurs when you get completely(!) unballanced partitions. This means you get a
split of n elements and 0 elements.

    T(n) = T(n-1) + O(n) --> O(n^2)

## Sorting Efficiency

    | Algorithm | Best     | Avergage | Worst    |
    | Quicksort | n*log(n) | n*log(n) | n^2      |
    | Mergesort | n*log(n) | n*log(n) | n*log(n) |
    | Insertion | n        | n^2      | n^2      |

# Homework Review

For two polynomials P(x) and Q(x), GCD(P(x), Q(x)) = 1

Warm Up problems:

    P(x) = x^2 + x + 1
    P(x^3) = (x^3)^2 + x^3 + 1

    GCD(x^9 - 1, x^6 - 1) = (x^3 + 1)

Actual Problem:

    P(x) = S(x)*r(x)
    Q(x) = T(x)*r(x)

    GCD(S(x), T(x)) = 1
    a * S(x) + b * T(x) = 1

    x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = a * S(x)
    x^3 + x^2 + x     = b * T(x)
