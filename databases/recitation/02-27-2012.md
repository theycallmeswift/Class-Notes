# Homework 2 Solutions

## Question 1:

### 1a)

Insert 1,2
Directory Size: 1

    [ ] -> [1,2]

Insert 4
Directory Size: 2

    [0] -> [2, 4]
    [1] -> [1, null]

Insert 6
Directory Size: 4
Global Depth: 2

    [00] -> [4, null]     Depth: 2
    [01] -> [1, null]     Depth: 1
    [10] -> [2, 6]        Depth: 2
    [11] -> [Ptr to [01]] Depth: 1

Insert 10
Directory Size: 8
Global Depth: 3

    [000] -> [4, null]      Depth: 2
    [001] -> [1, null]      Depth: 1
    [010] -> [2, 10]        Depth: 3
    [011] -> [Ptr to [001]]
    [100] -> [Ptr to [000]]
    [101] -> [Ptr to [001]]
    [110] -> [6, null]      Depth: 3
    [111] -> [Ptr to [001]]

### 1b)

Initial State:

    [0] -> [6, 10]
    [1] -> [null, null]

Insert 2:

    [00] -> [null, null]
    [01] -> [null, null]
    [10] -> [6,10]
    [11] -> [Ptr to [01]]

    // Still need to split again!

### 1c)

Order 2: Each Node can hold 4 entries and 5 ptrs

      Max Entries in full B+ Tree hight 5
    - Min Entries in B+ of height 5
    = Total Deletions Possible

Number of Leaf nodes = `5^5`

Number of Data Entries / node = `4`

Max Entries in full B+ tree of height 5 = `5^5 * 4`

Min Entries in leaf nodes: `3^4 * 2 * 2`

Explaination of Min: The root node can have onely 1 entry, but the other 4
node levels need to have 2 entries.

Total: `5^5 * 4 - 3^4 * 2 * 2` = `12,176`

## Question 2

 - Seek: 10ms
 - Rotational Delay: 5ms
 - Transfer: 1ms / page
 - Buffer Size: 320 pages
 - File Size: 10 million pages

### 2a)

    # Passes Needed = log_(b-1)[ Ceil(N/B) ]
                    = log_319 [ Ceil( 10 million / 320 ) ]
                    = 3 passes


    Pass 0: Sorted Runs of 320 pages: 10m / 320 = 31,250 runs
    Pass 1: 319 Merge = 31,250 / 319 = 98
    Pass 2: 98 / 319 = 1

### 2b)

Pass 0:

    Random: 16ms * 10m records * 2 I/Os = 320,000,000 ms
    Sequential: 31,250 * (15 * 320) * 2 I/Os = 20,937,500 ms
    Read Random, Write Seq: 16ms * 10m + 31,250 * (15 + 320) = 170,468,750 ms

Pass 1 & 2:

    2 * 2 * 16ms * 10m = 640,000,000

Total:

    960,000,000ms or 660,937,500ms or 810,468,750ms

### 2c)

    # of Passes: Ceil[log16(10m / 16)] + 1 = 6 Passes

Pass 0: Same cost as before

Passes 1 - 5:

    Total Runs Read: 10m / 16 = 625,000 runs / pass
    Read Cost: 625,000 * (15ms + 16 pages * 1ms)

    Total Runs Write: 10m / 64 = 156,250 runs / pass
    Write Cost: 156,250 * (15ms + 64 pages * 1ms)

    Total Cost / Pass = 31,718,750

Total:

      Cost of Pass 0 + 5 * Cost / Pass
    = Cost of Pass 0 + (5 * 31,718,750)
    = Cost of Pass 0 + 478,593,750
