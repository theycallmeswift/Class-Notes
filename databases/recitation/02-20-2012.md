# 13.1

For each of the following situations, answer the following questions:

 1. # of runs in pass 0?
 2. Total # of passes?

    Ceiling( logB-1(N/B)) + 1

 3. Total I/O cost?

    2 I/Os per page
    Total I/O = 2 * # of passes * # of pages

 4. # of buffer pages needed to sort in 2 passes?

    B - 1 >= Ceiling(N/B)
    B * (B-1) >= N

a) A file with 10,000 pages, 3 buffer pages

  1. Ceiling(10,000 / 3) = 3334 runs

  2. Ceiling( logB-1(N/B)) + 1
     Ceiling(log2(3334)) + 1 = 13 passes

  3. 2 * 13 * 10,000 = 260,000

  4. B * (B-1) >= 10,000
     B = 101

b) A file with 20,000 pages, 5 buffer pages

  1. Ceiling(20,000 / 5) = 4000 runs

  2. Ceiling( logB-1(N/B)) + 1
     Ceiling(log4(4000)) + 1 = 7 passes

  3. 2 * 7 * 20,000 = 280,000

  4. B * (B-1) >= 20,000
     B = 142

c) A file with 2,000,000 pages, 17 buffer pages

  1. Ceiling(2,000,000 / 17) = 117,648 runs

  2. Ceiling( logB-1(N/B)) + 1
     Ceiling(log16(117,648)) + 1 = 6 passes

  3. 2 * 6 * 2,000,000 = 24,000,000

  4. B * (B-1) >= 2,000,000
     B = 1,415

# 13.2

For each of the following situations, answer the following questions:

 1. # of runs in pass 0?
 2. Total # of passes?

    Ceiling(log2(N/1)) + 1

 3. Total I/O cost?

    2 I/Os per page
    Total I/O = 2 * # of passes * # of pages

 4. # of buffer pages needed to sort in 2 passes?

In a 2 way external sort, you only use 2 buffer pages, so this isn't possible.

a) A file with 10,000 pages, 3 buffer pages

  1. Ceiling(10,000 / 1) = 10,000 runs

  2. Ceiling(log2(N/1)) + 1
     Ceiling(log2(10,000)) + 1 = 15 passes

  3. 2 * 15 * 10,000 = 300,000

  4. Not possible

b) A file with 20,000 pages, 5 buffer pages

  1. Ceiling(20,000 / 1) = 20,000 runs

  2. Ceiling(log2(N/1)) + 1
     Ceiling(log2(20,000)) + 1 = 16 passes

  3. 2 * 16 * 20,000 = 640,000

  4. Not possible

c) A file with 2,000,000 pages, 17 buffer pages

  1. Ceiling(2,000,000 / 1) = 2,000,000 runs

  2. Ceiling(log2(N/1)) + 1
     Ceiling(log2(2,000,000)) + 1 = 22 passes

  3. 2 * 22 * 2,000,000 = 88,000,000

  4. Not possible

# 14.3

Schema: ename, title dname, address (Each same length)
Query: `SELECT DISTINCT E.title, E.ename FROM E`
ename is a candidate key
E contains 10,000 pages, 10 buffer pages

## 1. Number of Runs in first pass? Avg length per run? I/O cost of pass?

    10,000 pages * 2/4 attributes = 5,000 pages
    5,000 pages / 20 buffer pages = 250 runs

    10,000 I/Os + 5,000 I/Os = 15,000 I/Os

## 2. Total  # of passes? Total I/O?

    Ceiling(log10(250)) = 3 runs
    2 * 3 * 5,000 = 30,000 I/Os

## 3. Clustered / unclustered B+ Tree on (a) title, (b) ename, (c) (ename, title)

Clusterd index on title: `2,500 + 10,000 = 12,500 I/Os`
Unclusted index on title: `2,500 + 10,000 * 10 tuples/page = 102,500 I/Os`
