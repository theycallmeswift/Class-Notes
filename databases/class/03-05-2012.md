# Review

## Background

`R(a,b,c,d)`
`S(b,e,f,g)`
`T(f,g)`

R has 12,000 tuples in 120 pages
S has 4,000 tuples in 40 pages
T has 2,000 tuples in 10 pages

B = 10

Each tuple in S joins with 3 tuples in R on average
Each tuple in T joins with 2 tuples in S on average

## Query

    SELECT R.a, T.k
    FROM  R, S, T
    WHERE R.b = S.b AND S.f = T.d
    AND R.c = 10 and S.g > 1,000

## Possible Plans

We would consider the following left deep plans:

    ((R S) T)
    ((S R) T)
    ((S T) R)
    ((T S) R)

## Costs

### Simple Nested Loop

R Join S:

    120 pages in R + 12,000 tuples * 40 pages in S = 480,120 I/Os

S Join R:

    40 pages in S + 4,000 tuples in S * 120 pages in R = 480,040 I/Os

### Page Nested Loop

R Join S:

    120 pages in R + 120 pages in R * 40 pages in S = 4,920 I/Os

S Join R:

    40 pages in S + 40 pages in S * 120 pages in R = 4,940 I/Os

### Block Nested Loop

R Join S:

    120 pages in R + Ceil(120/8) blocks * 40 pages in S = 720 I/Os

S Join R:

    40 pages in S + Ceil(40/8) blocks * 120 pages in R = 640 I/Os

### Sort Merge Join

Join:

    120 + 40 = 160 I/Os

Sort R:

    # of passes = log9(12) = 1.xxxx = 2

    Pass 0: 2 * 120 pages = 240 I/Os
    Pass 1: 2 * (1 run of 90 pages + 1 run of 30 pages) = 240 I/O
    Pass 2: 2 * 1 run of 120 pages = 240 I/Os

    Total: 720

Sort S:

    # of passes = 1
    4 runs of 10 pages

    Pass 0: 2 * 40 pages in S = 80 I/Os
    Pass 1: 2 * 40 pages in S = 80 I/Os

    Total: 160

Total: `1,040`

### Unlimited Buffer

The fastest join with unlimited buffer space is Block Nested Loop.  (Minimum
buffer size would be 42)

### Size of Output

    12,000 tuples of R Join S (Size of R tuple + size of S tuple)
    7/8 * 240 pages (If we ignore one 'b')

    R.c = 10 -> 10% of tuples
    S.g > 100 -> 50% of tuples


1) Apply selction on R.c (clustered index on c)

    height of tree = 4
    leaf nodes = 3
    # of pages = 120 * .10 = 12

    Total = 19 I/Os

2) Join with S (BNL)

    Reading R: 12 (Ignored if we pipeline)
    Loops over S: ceil(12/8) * 40 = 2

3) Apply selection of S on the fly after join

    Leaves us 600 tuples
    Each tuple is size 2 (R fields + S fields)
    100 tuples per page / 2 tuples = 50 pages
    600 pages / 50 = 12 pages

If we drop the fields we don't need, this is reduced to 3 pages!

4) Join with T (BNL)

    Outer relation: 3 (ignored from pipelining)
    Inner relation: 10

    Total: 10

Total Cost:

    19 + 80 + 10 = 109 I/Os
    600 tuples of size .5 resulting in 3 pages

## Problem 2

    SELECT P.A, Q.B, R.C
    FROM P, Q, R
    WHERE P.A = Q.A AND Q.B = R.B

### Possible Orderings

    ((P Q) R)
    ((Q P) R)
    ((Q R) P)
    ((R Q) P)
    ((P R) Q) // Not considered x-product
    ((R P) Q) // Not considered x-product

### Number of Alternatives

There would be 6 right deep orderings (mirror of left)

0 center orderings since 4 is the minimum

12 total orderings

## Problem 3

### Background

    R(__A__,__B__,C)

Index is stored in a grid file in main memory and we always partition on A

### Query 1

    SELECT *
    FROM R
    WHERE R.a = 6 AND R.b = 5

How many disk blocks will we need to access?

Since a,b is the key there is only one tuple. We can use the grid file to get
that, so 1 disk access is needed.

### Query 2

    SELECT *
    FROM R
    WHERE R.a = 6

We would need to scan all the tuples where a = 6. (cost: 1 + overflow)

### Query 3

    SELECT *
    FROM R
    WHERE R.b = 5

We would need to scan the whole grid file since we partition based on A.

### Query 4

    SELECT *
    FROM R
    WHERE R.c = 5

We need to scan the whole file since there is no index on c

## Problem 4

1) F (This is exactly what they are used for)
2) F (locality is not preserved)
3) F (We want to preserve symetry, but has tables don't do that)
