# Query Optimization

We can't spend hours deciding what the best plan is for a query that would
only take a matter of minutes.  To prevent this System R only considers a
small subset of possible plans (Ex. Left Deep Paths).

One of the most critical parts of query optimization is estimation.  Selection
conditions are usually considered to be independent in this class, but in
reality the data can have a correlation (Ex. Age and Salary).

## Nearest Neighbor Queries

Given we are looking at a specific tuple and we want to find other tuples with
similar attributes, how can we do it?

If we only have a one dimensional query, we can just scroll up and down in the
index and select nearby tuples. Easy.

When we have a two dimensional query, we can't do the same thing even if we
have an index on both attributes.  This is because tuples are ordered
lexicographically:

   (1, 2), (1, 1000), (1, 2000), (2,2), (2, 1000,), ....

In this case (1,2) would be closer to (1,1000) than (2,2).

### Z Ordering Curver

We can order the bits by a binary representation of the data's value and
traverse the data in quadrants.  This preserves the idea of proximity while
doing a full traversal of the data.

![Z Ordering](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Z-curve.svg/567px-Z-curve.svg.png)

For example: (X and Y are the binary representations of age and salary)

    x = 00, y = 10 -> z = 1000
    x = 10, y = 11 -> z = 1110
    x = 00, y = 00 -> z = 0000
    x = 01, y = 00 -> z = 0010

If I want a single point, all I need to do is convert the query parameters to
binary values and look it up by z score. (Ex: x = 2, y = 3 -> z = 1110)

For a range I do the same thing and traverse the curve.  The main problem is
that there are some large diagonal jumps between the areas of the graph.  In
that case we need to calculate all the possible ranges and check each one.

### Hilbert Curve

Just look at this: `http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve`

    11 |         4   5
    10 | 3           6
    01 |     2
    00 | 1
       |---|---|---|---
         00  01  10  11

This graph represents my directory structure. I could partition this in a
number of ways. For example:

    1: [1,2]
    2: [3]
    3: [6]
    4: [4,5]

If I now insert point 7 in the same quadrant as `4, 5`, the partition looks
like this:


    11 |         4   5
    10 | 3       7   6
    01 |     2
    00 | 1
      |---|---|---|---
        00  01  10  11

    1: [1,2]
    2: [3]
    3: [6]
    4: [5]
    5: [4, 7]
