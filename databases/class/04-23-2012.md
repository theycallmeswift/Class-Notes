# Security 

## Background

Relations:

    Employee (ename, dept, salary)

Views:

    EmployeeNames (ename)
    DeptInfo (dept, avg-salary)

### SQL for the Views

    CREATE VIEW EmployeeName(ename)
    AS SELECT ename
       FROM Employee


    CREATE VIEW DeptInfo (dept, avg-salary)
    AS SELECT dept, AVG(salary) as avg-salary
       FROM Employee
       GROUP BY dept


## Access

How do we give access to the users who need to see the views?

- View the average department salary

    GRANT SELECT ON DeptInfo TO Alice

- Fire people from the company

    GRANT DELETE ON Employee TO ...

- Check who is employed

    GRANT SELECT ON EmployeeName TO ...

## Revoking Access

Joe -> Mike `GRANT SELECT ON Employee`

How do we revoke the access Joe gave Mike?  We could revoke Joe's GRANT
option, but that would revoke all GRANTS that Joe gave out.
