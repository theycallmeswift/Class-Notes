# ARIES Recovery Manager

ARIES is a recovery manager that opperates in an enviornment which is "No
Force" and "Steal".

             | No Steal | Steal |
    Force    | Trivial  |       |  Durability
    No Force |          |   X   |
                  Atomicity

## Phases of Recovery

ARIES has three main phases of recovery:

 1. Analysis
 2. Redo
 3. Undo

## Logging

What do we log in order to roll back:

 - __Writes__ - Write down the old and new values
 - __Begin__ - where transactions start
 - __Commit / Abort__

We use Write Ahead Logging to ensure that the log is persisted to disk before
any data leaves the buffer or any data is committed to disk.  This ensures that
any point of failure is recoverable.

Committing a transaction is in effect writing all the steps to disk via the
log and then writing the data values to disk afterwards. That way anything
that goes wrong can be recovered.

### Log Records

    LSN PavLSN Xid type   pageID length buffer before after
                   update
                   commit
                   abort
                   end
                   CLR

CLR records are records of undo / redo opperations during recovery.

LSN - (Log Sequence Number) - Each page in main memory has an LSN that corresponds to the latest change it
was responsible for within the log.

### Other Tables

Transaction Table

    cache active X, Xid, status, Last LSN

Dirty Page Table - 1 entry per page in the buffer pool containing the most
recent LSN.
