# Solutions to HW1

## Problem 1
| # | Problem  | Min           | Max     |
| a | R1 U R2  | N2            | N1 + N2 |
| b | R1 ∩ R2  | 0             | N1      |
| c | R1 - R2  | 0             | N1      |
| d | R1 x R2  | (N1 * N2) / 2 | N1 * N2 |
| e | σa=5(R1) | 0             | N1      |
| f | πa (R1)  | N1            | N1      |
| g | R1 / R2  | 0             | 0       |
| h | R2 / R1  |

Note: R1 / R2 - For each record in R2, there is a tuple in R1 that contains these
attributes. R2 must be less than or equal to R1 for this to be possible.

## Problem 2

Assuptions:

    S = # of tuples that satisfy the condition
    S = ((100,000 - Val) / 100,000) * 1 billion

    Cost of sequential scan is ~ 10 million I/Os (# of pages)

A. Cost of B+ Tree is:

    4 + Cost of Index + Cost of Tuples < 10 million
    4 + (S / 1000) + S < 10 million
    4 + 1 million - 10 * Val + 1000 million - 10,000 * Val < 10 million
    val > 99,000

B. Cost of B+ Tree is:

    4 + Cost of Index + Cost of Tuples < 10 million
    4 + (S / 1000) < 10 million
    4 + 1 million - 10 * val < 10 million

## Problem 3

1 block = 4k bytes = 4,096 - 50 bytes for header = 4,046 bytes for tuples

Relations:

    Rc   250 bytes   15k
    Rp   200 bytes   45k
    Rm   100 bytes   135k

1. Sequential scan

Company:

    4,046 bytes / 250 bytes = 16 tuples/block
    15K / 16 tuples/block = 938 blocks

Product:

    4,046 bytes / 200 bytes = 20 tuples/block
    45K / 20 tuples/block = 2,250 blocks

Model:

    4,046 bytes / 100 bytes = 40 tuples/block
    135K / 40 tuples/block = 3,375 blocks

Total: `6,563 blocks`

2. Clustered scan

Each Company:

    250 + 3 * 200 + 9 * 100 = 1,750 bytes/company

We can store 2 companies per block

Total: `15k/2 = 7,500 blocks`


### Cost of Table Scan on Company

Sequential: 938 I/Os
Clustered:  7,500 I/Os

### Cost of Join Query

Sequential:

    log_2(938) = 10
    log_2(2,250) = 12
    3 * log_2(3,375) = 36

    Total I/Os: 58

Clustered:

    log_2(7,500) = 13
